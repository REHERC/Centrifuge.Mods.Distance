## How to Use
### Spectrum
In order to use this plugin, you need to install Spectrum first. Download the latest Spectrum release zip from [here](https://github.com/Ciastex/Spectrum/releases/latest) (*not* the source code).

1. Extract the zip and copy the contents to your Distance instalation directory (`/Steam/steamapps/common/Distance/Distance_Data/`).
   * The zip will countain a `/Spectrum/` folder and a `/Managed/` folder.
2. Make sure to merge `/Managed/` with `/Distance/Distance_Data/Managed/`
   * Also make sure to put `/Spectrum/` inside `/Distance/Distance_Data/`  
3. Patch the game with Prism by using `/Distance/Distance_Data/Managed/install_windows.bat` (or the linux equivalent).  
   * If you have a console with succes stuff, it's good :)
