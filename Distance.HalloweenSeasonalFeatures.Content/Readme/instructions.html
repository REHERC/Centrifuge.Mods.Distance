<h1 style="color:red;"><b>IMPORTANT NOTE FROM THE DEVELOPER</b></h1>
<p>
    This mod is currently unfinished meaning there are bugs (known ones and potentially more).<br/>
    Use this mod at your own risk: any competitive advantage gained from using this mod is not the developer's fault as this mod is made for entertainment!
</p>
<h2>Known bugs:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Pumpking spawning in editor playtest won't disappear when going back to the level editor. Spawned objects won't be selectable/removeable either.</li>
    <li>Glitch effects on the spectrum (refractor) in the main menu will stop if the user opens a submenu (level selection, settings, ...). From that point onwards, the effect won't work again.</li>
    <li>The settings menu is currently not implemented showing an error message instead (intended behavior).</li>
    <li>Completing a trick won't play ghost laugh sound effects instead of an announcer voice line.</li>
    <li>The car's wheel hologram isn't a carved pumpkin (jack o' lantern) face by default.</li>
    <li>There is currently no way to use lamps instead of pumpkins as the randomly placed object on roads.</li>
</ul>
