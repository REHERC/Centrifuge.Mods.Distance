<h1>EDITING THE MESSAGES</h1>
<section>
	<h2>MODIFYING THE FILE</h2>
	<p>
		To edit the messages, go in the mod settings directory <span>Distance_Data/Centrifuge/Mods/{BuildPath}/Settings</span> and open <span>Config.json</span> with a text editor of your choice.
		If the file/folder is missing, please be sure you ran the game at least once after installing the mod so the default configuration is created.
		<a target="_blank" href="steam://rungameid/233610/-console">Click here to launch Distance (Steam only)</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		After you opened the file, the default configuration should look something like this:
		<span class="block">&lbrace;<br />
	"KillGrid": [<br />
		"The laser grid was not cool with &lbrace;0&rbrace;",<br />
		"&lbrace;0&rbrace; have touched the forbiden grid"<br />
	],<br />
	"SelfTermination": [<br />
		"&lbrace;0&rbrace; pressed the reset button",<br />
		"&lbrace;0&rbrace; commited sudoku"<br />
	],<br />
	"LaserOverheated": [<br />
		"&lbrace;0&rbrace; don't know how to drive without wheels",<br />
		"&lbrace;0&rbrace; was too hot"<br />
	],<br />
	"Impact": [<br />
		"&lbrace;0&rbrace; kissed a wall",<br />
		"The ground facepalmed &lbrace;0&rbrace;"<br />
	],<br />
	"Overheated": [<br />
		"&lbrace;0&rbrace; needs to stop boosting sometimes"<br />
	],<br />
	"AntiTunnelSquish": [<br />
		"&lbrace;0&rbrace; got unitied"<br />
	],<br />
	"StuntCollect": [<br />
		"&lbrace;0&rbrace; looted a x&lbrace;1&rbrace; multiplier!"<br />
	],<br />
	"KickNoLevel": [<br />
		"&lbrace;0&rbrace; is too poor to have this level",<br />
		"[FF0000]&lbrace;0&rbrace; is sad because he can't load the level[-]"<br />
	],<br />
	"Finished": [<br />
		"[FFFFFF]&lbrace;0&rbrace;[-] [00FF00]f[-][00FFFF]i[-][0000FF]n[-][FF00FF]i[-][FF0000]s[-][FFFF00]h[-][00FF00]e[-][00FFFF]d[-]"<br />
	],<br />
	"NotReady": [<br />

	],<br />
	"Spectate": [<br />
		"[-]This map is too hard, &lbrace;0&rbrace; gave up"<br />
	],<br />
	"TagPointsLead": [<br />
		"[FFFFFF]&lbrace;0&rbrace;[-] is [00FF00]f[-][00FFFF]a[-][0000FF]b[-][FF00FF]u[-][FF0000]l[-][FFFF00]o[-][00FF00]u[-][00FFFF]s[-]!"<br />
	]<br />
&rbrace;</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you don't know how to edit JSON files without breaking them, i recommend using an online editor like <a target="_blank" href="https://jsoneditoronline.org/">jsoneditoronline.org</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://jsonformatter.org/json-editor">jsonformatter.org/json-editor</a> (just paste the json in the left text zone and click the right arrow button; once you're done press the left arrow button and copy back the text from the left side into your Config.json file).
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>If Distance is running, restart it for the changes to take effect.</b>
	</p>
	<h2>TEXT REPLACEMENT CODES</h2>
	<p>
		When editing your messages, you can use (inline) replacement codes to display specific values when the message is sent.
		<ul>
			<li><b>&lbrace;0&rbrace;</b> displays the colorized current player username.</li>
			<li><b>&lbrace;1&rbrace;</b> displays the current stunt multiplier (displays 0 if the parent group isn't <u>StuntCollect</u>).</li>
			<li><b>&lbrace;2&rbrace;</b> displays the current player username as raw text (without colors).</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h2>TEXT FORMATTING</h2>
	<p>
		For any instructions on how to make text bold or italic, follow the instructions on this page: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tasharen.com/forum/index.php?topic=6706.0">Topic: UILabel (tasharen.com)</a>. If you want to get rid of the tan color on your message, just begin the line with <span>[-][/c]</span>
